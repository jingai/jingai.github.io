Creates Events, Albums, Faces, Places, Keywords, and Ratings listings.","body":"iPhoto plugin for XBMC\r\n======================\r\nThis plugin imports an iPhoto or Aperture library into XBMC.  After importing,\r\nyou will see categories that correspond with their application counterparts:\r\n\r\n* Events/Projects\r\n* Albums\r\n* Faces\r\n* Places\r\n* Keywords\r\n* Ratings\r\n\r\nYour photo library can reside locally (on the machine on which you run XBMC)\r\nor can be located on a network share.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\nThe plugin needs to know where your AlbumData.xml file is.  If you haven't\r\nexplicitly pointed iPhoto to a non-standard library location, the default of\r\n\"~/Pictures/iPhoto Library\" should work fine.  Otherwise, please enter in the\r\ncorrect path in the plugin's settings dialog.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no default path if you're using Aperture.  You will need to\r\nspecify the path to the library that contains the ApertureData.xml.  Aperture\r\ncan support multiple libraries, but this plugin currently only supports one.\r\n\r\nALSO NOTE: Aperture will ONLY generate the required ApertureData.xml if you\r\nhave enabled \"Share previews with iLife and iWork\" in Preferences->Previews.\r\n\r\nThe iPhoto plugin can also be configured to ignore certain album types.\r\nIt is currently hard-coded to ignore albums of type \"Book\" and\r\n\"Selected Event Album,\" but you can choose to ignore also:\r\n\r\n* Empty -- albums with no pictures.\r\n* Published -- MobileMe Gallery albums.\r\n* Flagged -- albums flagged in your photo application's interface.\r\n* Keywords -- any photos with these keywords will be hidden.\r\n\r\nAll of these album types are ignored by default.\r\n\r\nIf you select \"Auto update library\", the plugin will compare the modification\r\ntime of your Library's XML file with its current database and update the\r\ndatabase automatically on start.  This is disabled by default, but is probably\r\nwhat you want after testing the plugin.\r\n\r\nYou can also choose the view style for albums if you're using select skins.\r\nIn Confluence, you may set this to \"Image Wrap\" or \"Pic Thumbs\".\r\nIn Metropolis, you may set this to \"Galary Fanart\" or \"Picture Grid\".\r\nIn all skins, if you choose \"Default,\" it will preserve whatever view mode you\r\nhave chosen in XBMC for each album; otherwise, it will force the view style to\r\nthe one selected here.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferenced and Managed Libraries\r\n================================\r\niPhoto and Aperture give you the option of managing your photos for you, by\r\nplacing a copy of them within the library itself, or referencing your\r\noriginals, leaving them in their original location on the filesystem.\r\n\r\nIf your library is managed, you will select \"Managed Library\" in the plugin\r\nsettings (this is the default).\r\n\r\nIf your library is referenced and you are running XBMC on the same machine\r\nthat you use iPhoto or Aperture, you may also select \"Managed Library\".\r\n\r\nIf your library is referenced and resides on a share over the network,\r\nyou need to tell the plugin how to access the originals.  If on the\r\nmachine you use iPhoto or Aperture your originals are accessed via, for\r\ninstance, \"/Volumes/Media/Pictures\", they may not be mounted at the same point\r\non the machine on which you run XBMC.  If this is the case, you will need to\r\nconfigure the \"Local root path to masters\" and \"Rewrite root path as\"\r\noptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Places support\r\n====================\r\nIf the plugin is configured to support the Places feature of iPhoto or\r\nAperture, it will parse the latitude/longitude pairs in the library and look\r\nup the corresponding addresses using Google.\r\n\r\nIf Google reports one or more businesses near the coordinates, the plugin\r\nwill use the name of the nearest business for the address to show in the\r\nPlaces category.  Otherwise, the street address will be used.  In both cases,\r\nthe post code and country identifier are appended to the result.\r\n\r\nThe Places feature can also download map images to display while you're\r\nbrowsing the Places category.  Normally, you won't need to do anything to get\r\nthis feature, besides enabling it in the plugin configuration.  But, if you\r\nimport your library many times within one day, Google may block you from\r\nretrieving map images.  If you receive a map image with a red X over it, the\r\nplugin won't re-download the map until you clear the map image caches.  You\r\ncan do so by selecting \"Remove cached maps\" from the context menu of the\r\nPlaces category.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslations\r\n============\r\nIf you'd like to help translate this plugin to another language, please send\r\na patch to jingai at floatingpenguins dot com.\r\n\r\nIf possible, patch against the most recent version at:\r\n\r\n  http://github.com/jingai/plugin.image.iphoto\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\n* Keywords are not supported in iPhoto 9.4 and all versions of Aperture.\r\n  See http://github.com/jingai/plugin.image.iphoto/issues/4\r\n* Ratings are not supported in Aperture.\r\n  See http://github.com/jingai/plugin.image.iphoto/issues/6\r\n* Selecting previous picture sometimes erroneously selects next instead\r\n  See http://trac.xbmc.org/ticket/11826\r\n* Can only set default view mode in select skins\r\n  See http://trac.xbmc.org/ticket/9952\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance\r\n==========\r\nIf you need help getting the plugin to work, please visit my thread on the\r\nXBMC forums:\r\n\r\n  http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=77612\r\n\r\nWhen asking for help or reporting a potential bug, please be prepared to post\r\nyour debug log from XBMC and, if you don't mind, your AlbumData.xml from your\r\niPhoto library or ApertureData.xml from an Aperture library.
